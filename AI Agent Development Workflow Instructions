# AI Agent Development Workflow Instructions

## Initial Setup Requirements

1. Before starting any development work:
   - Verify the current git branch (should be on `feature/[feature-name]` for new features)
   - Check for any pending dependencies in `package.json`
   - Review the current state in `ROADMAP.md`
   - Ensure test environment is properly configured

## Development Workflow

### 1. Pre-Development Checklist
- [ ] Review related items in `ROADMAP.md`
- [ ] Create new feature branch if needed: `feature/[feature-name]`
- [ ] Update task status in `ROADMAP.md` from ðŸ”´ to ðŸŸ¡
- [ ] Check for required dependencies
- [ ] Review existing tests related to the feature area

### 2. Development Process
For each development task:

1. **Dependencies Management**
   ```bash
   # Before adding new code
   - Check package.json for required dependencies
   - Install new dependencies with exact versions
   - Update package.json and package-lock.json
   - Document new dependencies in README.md
   ```

2. **Code Implementation**
   ```bash
   # Follow these steps for each feature
   - Implement feature following architecture guidelines
   - Create/update necessary TypeScript types
   - Add necessary comments and documentation
   - Implement error handling
   - Add logging where appropriate
   ```

3. **Testing Requirements**
   ```bash
   # Create tests before committing
   - Write unit tests for new components
   - Write integration tests for API endpoints
   - Write E2E tests for critical flows
   - Ensure test coverage meets requirements
   - Run full test suite: npm test
   ```

### 3. Documentation Updates

Update the following files when applicable:

1. **README.md**
   - New features or functionality
   - Updated dependencies
   - Changed configuration requirements
   - New environment variables

2. **ROADMAP.md**
   - Update task status (ðŸ”´ â†’ ðŸŸ¡ â†’ ðŸŸ¢)
   - Update progress percentages
   - Add any new subtasks discovered
   - Update completion dates

3. **ARCHITECTURE.md**
   - New components or services
   - Changed architectural decisions
   - New integration points
   - Updated technical requirements

### 4. Commit Guidelines

Follow this process for each commit:

```bash
# 1. Stage changes
git add [files]

# 2. Commit with semantic message
git commit -m "type(scope): description"

# Types:
# feat: New feature
# fix: Bug fix
# docs: Documentation only
# test: Adding tests
# chore: Maintenance tasks

# 3. Update progress
- Update ROADMAP.md with new progress
- Mark tasks as complete
- Update overall progress percentage
```

### 5. Pull Request Process

Before creating a PR:
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Verify ROADMAP.md is updated
- [ ] Check for any new environment variables
- [ ] Ensure code meets style guidelines
- [ ] Verify all new dependencies are documented

### 6. Continuous Integration

After pushing changes:
- Monitor CI/CD pipeline
- Address any test failures
- Fix linting issues
- Update documentation if needed based on CI feedback

## Phase-Specific Guidelines

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Ensure all basic configurations are documented
- Set up comprehensive test framework
- Document all environment variables
- Create basic API documentation

### Phase 2: Core Features
- Implement feature flags for new capabilities
- Document AI service configurations
- Create user guides for new features
- Add monitoring for AI services

### Phase 3: Platform Integration
- Document all API credentials needed
- Create integration test suite
- Document error handling for external services
- Add monitoring for third-party services

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features
- Focus on performance optimization
- Document mobile-specific features
- Create advanced feature documentation
- Add analytics tracking

## Error Handling Guidelines

1. Always implement proper error boundaries
2. Log errors appropriately
3. Provide user-friendly error messages
4. Add error tracking for AI services
5. Implement retry mechanisms for external services

## Performance Guidelines

1. Optimize image processing
2. Implement proper caching
3. Use lazy loading where appropriate
4. Monitor API response times
5. Optimize database queries

## Security Guidelines

1. Validate all inputs
2. Sanitize data before storage
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Use proper authentication
5. Follow OWASP guidelines

## Monitoring and Logging

1. Add appropriate log levels
2. Implement performance monitoring
3. Track AI service usage
4. Monitor external API calls
5. Track user interactions

Remember to always:
- Keep the codebase clean and documented
- Maintain test coverage
- Update documentation continuously
- Follow security best practices
- Monitor performance metrics
